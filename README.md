#INTRODUCTION

The problem at hand is to develop a web-based EBook platform that allows users to
explore, purchase, and manage digital books efficiently. Users need a convenient way
to register, browse through a diverse collection of EBooks, add them to their shopping
carts, place orders, and review their order history. On the other hand, administrators
require a tool to manage the EBook inventory effectively. To address these challenges,
we aim to create the EBooks Web Application.

2.1 Project Overview
Technology selected :
a. User Interface (UI):
• Java for server-side logic and business operations.
• JSP for dynamic web page rendering and user interface.
• Servlets to handle user requests, interact with the database, and manage the
application's flow.
b. Data Storage:
• MySQL Database for storing user data, ebook information, and transaction
records.
c. Server:
• Tomcat Server for deploying and running the web application.
d. Front-End Design:
• Bootstrap for creating a responsive and visually appealing front-end.
e. Security and User Interaction:
• Session Management for ensuring secure and efficient user interactions.
f. Project Structure:
• MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern for structuring the project for scalability
and maintainability.
